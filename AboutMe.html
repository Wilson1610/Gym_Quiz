            Welcome to the About me page, this page will be about my gym journey. <br /> <br />
            Here is a photo of myself on the left and for a suprise video of my squat, click on the photo. <br />
            I currently go gym 6 days a week using the arnold split which is: <br /> <br />
            Monday: Chest/Back <br />
            Tuesday: Shoulders/Arms <br />
            Wednesday: Legs/Lower <br />
            Thursday: Chest/Back <br />
            Friday: Shoulders/Arms <br />
            Saturday: Legs/Lower <br />
            Sunday: Rest <br /> <br />
            As mentioned before I have been going gym for roughly 4 years now, started taking it serious 2 years ago, I have a lot of passion in this field and would be happy to help anyone at all levels. <br />
            I am a member at puregym which I have been loyal to for the past 4 years. <br /> <br />
            My main goal of going to the gym is that I want to get stronger and build confidence in myself, gym also keeps myself motivated and disciplined and has become part of my lifestyle which I am proud of.
