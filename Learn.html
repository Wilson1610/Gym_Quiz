                Welcome to the gym website, this website has been created as part of a University coursework project. This website will contain Quizes on the topic of gym and fitness,
                "Quizes" on the navigation bar will take you to a page of quizes or you can click on the image on the left too!  The "Learn" page will allow you to learn the topics of the quizes and will also contain
                external links such as youtube/researches to gain a better understanding of the topics. "About Me" is pretty self explanatory, it will be a page about me and what I do at the gym and outside the gym.
                The last link "Contact Us" will contains my emails to allow you to contact me about helping out with any quizes, any bug fixes or suggestions, or just aks me any questions in general!
